  🤖 Agentic AI Tip #4 — How to Select an Agent: Three UIs, One Concept
  
  You have dozens of agents available. How do you pick one? It depends on the tool.
  
  *VSCode Chat — dropdown menu:*
  At the bottom of the Chat panel, click the agent name. A dropdown shows all available agents: DxPRReview, DxCodeReview, AEMComponent, etc. Pick one, and it becomes your active assistant with its own tools and persona. You'll also see "Configure Custom Agents..." to manage .agent.md files.
  
  *Copilot CLI — /agents command:*
  Type `/agents` in the terminal. You get a numbered list of all agents — plugin agents AND .github/agents/ agents. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select. The selected agent stays active for your session. You also see warnings if any .agent.md files have unsupported fields.
  
  *Claude Code — /agents command:*
  Type `/agents` for the full inventory. Claude Code shows the richest info: agent name with plugin prefix (`dx-aem:aem-inspector`), model tier (`sonnet`), and memory type (`project memory`). You see all 34 agents across installed plugins.
  
  *But here's the real pattern:*
  Most of the time, you don't manually select agents. *Skills auto-dispatch.* When you run `/dx-pr-review`, the skill automatically routes to the `dx-pr-reviewer` agent (Sonnet, with ADO MCP tools). The skill knows which agent is right for the job.
  
  Manual selection is for exploration. Auto-dispatch is for workflows.
  
  💡 Try it: Run `/agents` in both Claude Code and Copilot CLI. Compare the lists — Claude Code shows 13 plugin agents, Copilot shows 25 .github agents.
